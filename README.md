SEO Audit Tool Development

The goal of this tool is to generate two reports:

1. A report containing the summary of the SEO audit as well as the rating - for email reply to client after requesting an SEO audit.
On-page summary report (Rating: Failed, Needs Improvement, Passed)
Off-page summary report (Rating: Failed, Needs Improvement, Passed)
Technical SEO (page load, heavy images)
2. A more comprehensive report that will serve as basis for SEO strategy execution (in case a client wants to avail our SEO service)
